## Impressions ##

* Powerpoint slides - Simple, however not explanatory (adding photos would suffice) 

## Threshold Concepts ##
**Introduction to Mapping in R (Readings and Practice)**\
Introduction to R and how it can be used to manipulate data to convey information using ggplot2 to render points for death and pumps, ggmap to enhance the look of the map and kernel density for an quick showing of spatial analysis - *Good introduction that draws students into the course and how spatial statistics can be used to manipulate data*

**Session 1: Statistical Maps I (Activity)**\
Threshold Concept: Random vs. Non-Random\
Question 2. in the activity is key: By asking students *"rank the top five maps from most to least interesting"* most students are now thinking about the data being random vs. non-random and which one is more interesting 
* Good way to visualize and present the data 

**Mapping in R Continued (Reading and Practice)**\ 
Highlight ways of working with the data in R - more programming heavy (summarizing datasets, subsetting data, nesting functions) opposed to discussing themes and topics in the course.
This RMarkdown is all about playing around with the data and how visual maps can be manipulated according to code in R 

**Session 2: Statistical Maps II**\
Threshold Concept: Random vs. Non-Random\
Question 4. in the acitivty is key: by guessing where the next event would emerge based on the 4 maps made, students can better understand what makes a map random vs. non-random - random = cannot guess where the next event will take place, non-random = can guess where the next event will take place 

## Brainstorming ##
1. Take some time to explain code used in the Reading and Practice during class to help students better understand what they are reading at home 
* This could be something done for the first few lectures as the activities and readings/practice are not too hard to understand; it gives the students a good understanding of what the code is doing which can be beneficial 
* Once students are more familiar with the way coding works in R, specifically how its used to convey spatial statistics OR the topics of the course start getting introduced, cut down on the amount of coding tht is explained in class and instead focus on concepts like random vs. non-random, point patterns, etc. 

2. Use the last few minutes to go over questions from the activity (similar to last year) 

3. 01.Statistical Maps I contains 5 scripts: Data Preprocessing.R in the Snow Cholera folder, 00 Practice - Basic Operations and Data Structures.Rmd, 01 Practice - Introduction to Mapping in R.Rmd, Data Preprocessing.Rmd and 01 Session 1 - Statistical Maps.Rmd. 
* Combine Data Preprocessing.R and 01 Practice - Introduction to Mapping in R.Rmd into one Reading and Practice file
* They use the same data and arrive to the same conclusion - ggplot2 to plot points, ggmap to enhance look and kernel density 

4. Convert RMarkdowns to Shiny Applications for each lecture and tutorial
https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/ - link to examples of different applications that use shiny. Once one template has been designed and we are happy with how the data is presented, that same template can be used for all other letures. RMarkdown can be downloaded from the application made by Shiny.
