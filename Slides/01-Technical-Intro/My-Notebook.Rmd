This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

It is an example of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

Notebooks are text documents that include code. The text is meant to communicate with humans, the code with a computer. The code resides in *chunks*. 

The text file uses [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown provides lightweight text formatting functions. Markdown can be used to make:

# First level headers

## Second level headers

### Third level headers

1. Numbered lists
2. With items
3. Like this

Or:

- Unnumbered lists
- With items 
- Like this

> Block quotes

Horizontal rules

(This is below a horizontal rule)

You can use *italics* or _italics_ for emphasis.

Or **bold text**, also __bold text__.

If you want maximum emphasis, ***this is bolded italics***.

![Insert images](mcmaster_logo.png)
Or [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink).

We can also write mathematical notation using LaTeX. Inline math expressions are written this way: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$. Or mathematical expressions can be written this way:
$$
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
$$

Markdown can do [many more things](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html), but this is sufficient to begin.

Chunks of code can be inserted by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar, by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*, or simply by writing the chunk delimiters (three back-ticks, followed by the letter "r" in curly brackets, like this "```{r}". Three back-ticks end the chunk.

Try inserting a new chunk.

Packages.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
