This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. This is simply text, in natural language, meant to communicate with fellow humans.

It is an example of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

Notebooks are text documents that include code. The text is meant to communicate with humans, the code with a computer. The code resides in *chunks*. 

The text file uses [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown provides lightweight text formatting functions. Markdown can be used to make:

# First level headers

## Second level headers

### Third level headers

1. Numbered lists
2. With items
3. Like this
4. More items

Or:

- Unnumbered lists
- With items 
- Like this

> Block quotes
>> This is a nested block quote

Horizontal rules

---

(This is below a horizontal rule)

You can use *italics* or _italics_ for emphasis.

Or **bold text**, also __bold text__.

If you want maximum emphasis, ***this is bolded italics***.

![Insert images](mcmaster_logo.png)
Or [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink).

We can also write mathematical notation using LaTeX. Inline math expressions are written this way: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$. Or mathematical expressions can be written this way:
$$
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
$$

Markdown can do [many more things](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html), but this is sufficient to begin.

Chunks of code can be inserted by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar, by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*, or simply by writing the chunk delimiters (three back-ticks, followed by the letter "r" in curly brackets, like this "```{r}". Three back-ticks end the chunk.

Chunks of code is where we speak to the computer. Like this:
```{r}
library(geog4ga3)
```

In this chunk of code above, I loaded a package by using the function `library()`.

Once I loaded `geog4ga3` I want to know what it does. I can ask the computer to tell me if the package is documented:
```{r}
?geog4ga3
```

Here I used Ctrl-Alt-I to introduce a new chunk of code:
```{r}
data("Fast_Food")
```

Or you can just type the chunk delimiters:
```{r}
summary(Paez_Mart)
```

Try inserting a new chunk.
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cancensus")
```

Load `cancensus` and also `tidyverse` (a package for data manipulation and analysis that includes `ggplot2`):
```{r}
library(cancensus)
library(tidyverse)
```

Is this documented?
```{r}
?cancensus
```

No. But there is information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cancensus/vignettes/cancensus.html)

Store API key obtained from [CensusMapper](https://censusmapper.ca/):
```{r eval=FALSE}
set_api_key("your-key", install = TRUE)
```

Use `cancensus` to check and download census data. Check the regions:
```{r}
list_census_regions('CA16') %>% 
  filter(level == "CMA", name %in% c("Toronto"))
```
Retrieve data:
```{r eval=FALSE}
census_data <- get_census(dataset='CA16', 
                          regions=list(CMA=c("35535")),
                          vectors=c("v_CA16_408","v_CA16_409","v_CA16_410"),
                          level='CSD', use_cache = FALSE)
```

Install package for Toronto Open Data:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("opendatatoronto")
```

Load the package:
```{r}
library(opendatatoronto)
```

What can I do with this package? I will run one of the examples in the vignette:
```{r}
bike_parking_racks <- search_packages("Bicycle Parking Racks") %>%
  list_package_resources() %>%
  filter(name == "bicycle-parking-racks-wgs84") %>%
  get_resource()
```

What kind of object is this?
```{r}
class(bike_parking_racks)
```

Map this information:
```{r}
ggplot(data = bike_parking_racks) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = CAPACITY,
              size = CAPACITY))
```

To improve my map I am going to retrieve the neighborhoods in Toronto:
```{r}
neighbourhoods <- list_package_resources("https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/") %>%
  get_resource()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = bike_parking_racks) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = CAPACITY,
              size = CAPACITY)) +
  geom_sf(data = neighbourhoods,
          fill = NA) +
  scale_color_fermenter(palette = "YlOrRd", 
                        direction = 1)
```

Packages.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
