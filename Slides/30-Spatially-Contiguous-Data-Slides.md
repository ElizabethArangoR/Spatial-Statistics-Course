Key Concepts
========================================================

- Exploring spatially continuous data
- Voronoi polygons
- Inverse distance weighting
- K-point means

Exploring Spatially Continuous Data
========================================================
- Think of points as an event 
- Data could be temperature, elevation
- Sampling method is not random, but the VALUE at the sampling site

Tile-Based Methods
========================================================
- Another method of gathering spatially continuous data
- Convert points into closely fitted arrangement of shapes
- Example: Voronoi polygons
