#Introduction

NOTE: This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

In the last practice/session your learning objectives included:

1. The intuition behind the quadrat-based test of independence.
2. The concept of kernel density.
3. The limitations of density-based analysis
4. More ways to work with `ppp` objects.

Please review the previous practices if you need a refresher on these concepts.

For this practice you will need the following:

* This R markdown notebook.
#* Datasets called `Data3.RData` and `Data4.RData`.

`Data3.RData` includes a dataframe with four sets of spatial events, labeled as "Pattern 1", "Pattern 2", "Pattern 3", "PointPattern4", with n = 60 events in each set.

`Data4.RData` includes a `spatstat` `ppp`-class object with two sets of spatial events, labeled as "Pattern 1" and "Pattern 2"

#Learning objectives

In this practice, you will learn:

1. About clustered and dispersed (or regular) patterns.
2. The concept of nearest neighbors.
3. About distance-based methods for point pattern analysis.
4. About the G-function for the analysis of event-to-event nearest neighbor distances.

#Preliminaries

As usual, it is good practice to clear the working space to make sure that you do not have extraneous items there when you begin your work. The command in R to clear the workspace is `rm` (for "remove"), followed by a list of items to be removed. To clear the workspace from _all_ objects, do the following:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Note that `ls()` lists all objects currently on the worspace.

Load the libraries you will use in this activity:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(spatstat)
```

Load the datasets that you will use for this practice:
```{r}
load("Data3.RData")
load("Data4.RData")
```

There is a dataframe called `PointPatterns`. You can check this by means of the function class `class()`.
```{r}
class(PointPatterns)
```

In addition, there is a `ppp` object with two point patterns:
```{r}
class(pp1)
```

You have used both of these datasets previously. Before proceeding, convert the dataframe to a `ppp` object, using a square-unit window:
```{r}
W <- owin(xrange = c(0, 1), yrange = c(0, 1))
```

Now you can convert the dataframe into a `ppp` object:
```{r}
PointPatterns.ppp <- as.ppp(PointPatterns, W)
```

# Motivation


# Null landscapes revisited

```{r}
load("Data3.RData")
```


```{r}
W <- owin(c(0, 1), c(0, 1))
pp1 <- as.ppp(X = PointPatterns, W = W)
```

Plot:
```{r}
plot(split(pp1))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
Implement a simulation to test the kernel density estimates.

Use function `runifpoint()` to generate random point patterns:
```{r}
sim.ppp <- runifpoint(n = 60, W = W, nsim = 99)
```

The output is a list, with each element of the list a `ppp`.

Apply `density` to all elements of the list by means of `lapply`:
```{r}
sim_den <- lapply(sim.ppp, FUN = density)
```

Next, extract the density surfaces from the list of elements.
```{r}
den_env <- array(data = NA, dim = c(128, 128, 99))
for(s in 1:99){
  den_env[,,s] <- sim_den[[s]]$v
}
```

Find the max and min of the envelopes:
```{r}
max_env <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = nrow(den_env), ncol = ncol(den_env))
min_env <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = nrow(den_env), ncol = ncol(den_env))
for(i in 1:nrow(den_env)){
  for(j in 1:ncol(den_env)){
    max_env[i,j] <- max(den_env[i,j,])
    min_env[i,j] <- min(den_env[i,j,])
  }
}
```

Convert to `im` objects:
```{r}
max_env <- as.im(max_env, W = W)
min_env <- as.im(min_env, W = W)
```

Create a function to do all the simulation stuff:
```{r}
den_envelopes <- function(x = ppp, nsim = nsim, sigma = sigma){
  W <- x$window
  n <- x$n
  xden <- density(x)
  sim.ppp <- runifpoint(n = n, W = W, nsim = nsim)
  sim_den <- lapply(sim.ppp, FUN = density, sigma = sigma)
  den_env <- array(data = NA, dim = c(ncol(sim_den[[1]]$v), nrow(sim_den[[1]]$v), nsim))
  for(s in 1:nsim){
    den_env[,,s] <- sim_den[[s]]$v
  }
  max_env <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = nrow(den_env), ncol = ncol(den_env))
  min_env <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = nrow(den_env), ncol = ncol(den_env))
  for(i in 1:nrow(den_env)){
    for(j in 1:ncol(den_env)){
      max_env[i,j] <- max(den_env[i,j,])
      min_env[i,j] <- min(den_env[i,j,])
    }
  }
  #Convert to "im" objects
  max_env <- as.im(max_env, W = W)
  min_env <- as.im(min_env, W = W)
  #Compare the empirical density to the upper and lower envelopes
  max_env <- xden$v >= max_env
  min_env <- xden$v <= min_env
  #Create a list with the results
  as.imlist(list(Max = max_env, Min = min_env))
}
```

Apply the `den_envelopes` function to the first pattern and plot:
```{r}
envelopes <- den_envelopes(x = split(pp1)$"Pattern 1", nsim = 99, sigma = 0.1)
plot(envelopes)
```

Apply the `den_envelopes` function to the second pattern and plot:
```{r}
envelopes <- den_envelopes(x = split(pp1)$"Pattern 2", nsim = 99, sigma = 0.1)
plot(envelopes)
```

Apply the `den_envelopes` function to the third pattern and plot:
```{r}
envelopes <- den_envelopes(x = split(pp1)$"Pattern 3", nsim = 99, sigma = 0.1)
plot(envelopes)
```

Apply the `den_envelopes` function to the fourth pattern and plot:
```{r}
envelopes <- den_envelopes(x = split(pp1)$"Pattern 4", nsim = 99, sigma = 0.1)
plot(envelopes)
```

This concludes Practice 5. The next in-class activity will illustrate how quadrats are a useful tool to explore the question whether a map is random.
