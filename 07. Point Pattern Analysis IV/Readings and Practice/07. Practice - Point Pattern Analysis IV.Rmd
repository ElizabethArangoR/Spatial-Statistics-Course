#Introduction

NOTE: This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

In the last practice/session your learning objectives included:

1. Learning about clustered and dispersed (or regular) patterns.
2. Learning the concept of nearest neighbors.
3. Learning about distance-based methods for point pattern analysis.
4. Learning about the G-function for the analysis of event-to-event nearest neighbor distances.

Please review the previous practices if you need a refresher on these concepts.

For this practice you will need the following:

* This R markdown notebook.
* A dataset called `Data5.RData`.

`Data5.RData` includes five `spatstat` `ppp`-class objects.

#Learning objectives

In this practice, you will:

1. Learn about the F- or empty space function.
2. Consider the issue of patterns at multiple scales.
3. Learn about the K-function.
4. Apply both of these techniques using a simple example.

#Preliminaries

As usual, it is good practice to clear the working space to make sure that you do not have extraneous items there when you begin your work. The command in R to clear the workspace is `rm` (for "remove"), followed by a list of items to be removed. To clear the workspace from _all_ objects, do the following:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Note that `ls()` lists all objects currently on the worspace.

Load the libraries you will use in this activity:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(spatstat)
```

Load the datasets that you will use for this practice:
```{r}
load("Data5.RData")
```

# Motivation

Distance-based approaches like the $\hat{G}$-function provide a useful complement to density-based approached. They can be implemented in more ways than we have seen so far.

In this practice, you will learn about two more tools for doing distance-based analysis, the $\hat{F}$-function and the $\hat{K}$-function.

# F-function

The $\hat{G}$-function was defined as the cumulative distribution of the distances from _events_ to their nearest neighboring _event_. The $\hat{F}$-function is based on the same premise, but instead of using event-to-event distances, it uses point-to-event distances.

Recall that a point is an arbitrary location on a map that needs not necessarily be the location of an event. It may well be (and typically is) _empty space_. For this reason, the $\hat{F}$-function is sometimes called the _empty space function_: the more empty space there is in a region, the longer the distances of points to the nearest neighboring event.

More formally, this function is defined as follows, with $d_{ik}$ as the distance from the _point_ at i (not necessarily an event!) to its nearest neighboring event at k:
$$
\hat{F}(x)=\frac{(d_{ik}\le x, \forall i)}{n}
$$

Again, we use the hat notation to indicate that the function is estimated from the data.

The theoretical distribution of this function is known (based on a null landscape generated by a spatially random Poisson process), and is as follows:
$$
F_{pois}(x) = 1 - exp(-\lambda \pi x^2).
$$

Notice that the distribution is in fact identical to that for G. This makes sense: if the distribution of events is spatially random, the distribution of empty space in the region must be random as well!

The interpretation of $\hat{F}(x)$ is the opposite of $\hat{G}(x)$: When the empirical $\hat{F}(x)$ is greater than the theoretical function, this suggests that _empty spaces are closer to events_ than expected, compared to the null landscape, as in a dispersed pattern. On the contrary, when the empirical function is less than the theoretical function, this would suggest a clustered pattern.

The $\hat{F}$-function can be implemented in at least two ways: (1) by using a fine grid to measure the distance to events; or (2) by measuring the distance to events from randomly drawn coordinates. The implementation in `spatstat` is the first one, which results in a pixel-based image of empty space.

Let's illustrate this with the point pattern `pp1`.

You can verify that this is already a `ppp` object:
```{r}
class(pp1)
```

Begin by plotting the pattern:
```{r}
plot(pp1)
```

The empty space map is obtained by means of the `distmap` function:
```{r}
empty_space_map1 <- distmap(pp1) 
```

The plot of this is:
```{r}
plot(empty_space_map1)
```

Similar to the Stienen diagrams that you used previously, this map shows the distance from any location on the map to the nearest event: the smaller the value, the closer the point is to an event.

Compare the map above to `pp2`:
```{r}
empty_space_map2 <- distmap(pp2)
plot(empty_space_map2)
```

In the second point pattern, there is more open space in the region. This is also apparent from the dot map:
```{r}
plot(pp2)
```


The F-function is implemented in `spatstat` as `Fest` (for F estimated):
```{r}
f_pattern1 <- Fest(pp1, correction = "none")
```

This function can be plotted as follows:
```{r}
plot(f_pattern1)
```

Compare to the second pattern:
```{r}
f_pattern2 <- Fest(pp2, correction = "none")
plot(f_pattern2)
```

In the empirical pattern, points on a grid tend to be more distant from events than what you would expect from the null landscape: this suggests that the points are clustered.

Try plotting the $\hat{G}$-functions for these patterns, and compare.

# K-function

A limitation of the two techniques that you have seen so far is that they deal with a single scale: the k-th nearest neighbor (typically the first, although they can be used for the 2nd, 3rd, and so on nearest neighbor!).

Their single scale nature means that these functions can easily miss patterns at different scales.

Consider for instance the following point pattern:
```{r}
plot(pp3)
```

The events above seem to be clustered, but then a second pattern becomes apparent at a different scale: a regular distribution of clusters.

The following pattern, on the other hand, appears to be a random distribution of regularly spaced events:
```{r}
plot(pp4)
```

Whereas the last point pattern is of clusters of dispersed events that are themselves regularly spaced:
```{r}
plot(pp5)
```

Both $\hat{G}(x)$ or $\hat{F}(x)$ when applied to any of these patterns will detect clustering at the scale of the first nearest neighbor, but fail to detect patterns at other scales. For instance:
```{r}
g_pattern3 <- Gest(pp3, correction = "none")
plot(g_pattern3)
```

A different technique, called the $\hat{K}$-function, is designed to detect multiple scale patterns. The intuition behind the function is as follows. 

Imagine that you visit all events in the point patter in sequence. Each time you visit an event you do the following. You create a circle with radius "x" centered on the event, and then you count the number of events that are within the circle. Then you increase "x" by some distance, and repeat the process. Once that you have created the last circle (which will be suitably large to capture patterns at that scale), you move and visit the next event in the series and repeat the exact same process. These counts of events at distances "x" are aggregated and normalized by the estimated intensity of the point pattern.

More formally, this is (with $A$ as the area of the region):
$$
\hat{K}(x)=\frac{1}{\hat{\lambda}A}\sum_{i}\sum_{j\neq i}(d_{ij}\le x).
$$

As before, the theoretical values for this function are known for the case of a null landscape generated by a Poisson process:
$$
K_{pois}(x)=\pi x^2.
$$
When the empirical function is greater than the theoretical function, this would suggest that events are typically surrounded by _more_ events at that distance than what the null landscape would have. This is interpreted as evidence of clustering. 

In contrast, when the empirical function is less than the theoretical one, this would suggest that events are typically surrounded by _fewer_ events at that distance than what would be expected from a null landscape. This is interpreted as dispersion.

The $\hat{K}$-function is implemented in the package `spatstat` as `Kest`.

Lets plot again `pp3`:
```{r}
plot(pp3)
```

Next, lets calculate and plot the $\hat{K}$-function:
```{r}
k_pattern3 <- Kest(pp3, correction = "none")
plot(k_pattern3)
```

As seen from the plot, the function is suggestive of clustering at smaller scales, but regularity at a larger scale.

Try this now with the last pattern:
```{r}
plot(pp5)
```

If you calculate and plot the $\hat{K}$-function:
```{r}
k_pattern5 <- Kest(pp5, correction = "none")
plot(k_pattern5)
```

You will see that the plot correctly suggests dispersion at the very small scale, followed by clustering at an intermediate scale. There are indeed clusters of nine events surrounded by empty space, before other clusters of regular events are detected at the largest scale, following a regular pattern.

Of the distance-based techniques that you have seen so far, $\hat{G}(x)$ and $\hat{F}(x)$ are often used as complements. The $\hat{K}(x)$ is useful when exploring multi-scale patterns.

This concludes Practice 7, and our coverage of distance-based techniques.
