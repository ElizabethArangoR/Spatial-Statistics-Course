Spatially Continuous Data III
========================================================

autosize: true

Key Concepts
========================================================

- Measuring Spatial Dependence
- Semivarance, covariance
- Variographic Analysis

Recall: Residual Spatial Pattern
========================================================

- Trend surface analysis using Voronoi polygons, IDW, K-point means 
- Built-in mechanism for estimating unertainty of predictions
- ISSUE: We do not know the exact value at $p$ 

Interpolation and Randomness
========================================================

- Residuals are spatially dependent
- Allows us to make simple interpolations
- If residuals were random, it would be more difficult to interpolate
