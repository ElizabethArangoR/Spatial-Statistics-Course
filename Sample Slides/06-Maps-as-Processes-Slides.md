Key Concepts 
========================================================


- Different Degrees of Randomness
- Null Landscapes
- Deterministic Processes
- Stochastic Processes 
- Simulating Spatial Processes



Random Processes
========================================================
- Does not mean ANY outcome
- Ex: Rolling a dice, flipping a coin
- limited information available

Null Landscape
========================================================

<!---
Pay attention to the examples I provided below. I used the examples of tree distribution to show how trees can be randomly distributed over a landscape (forest) and systematically distributed on a tree farm (stochastic). The divide could be a result of a fense separating tree distribution.

***
- Using random variables to create random maps
- Difficult to predict results
- Example: Forests


Deterministic Processes
========================================================

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](06-Maps-as-Processes-Slides-figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

***
- No element of Randomness 
- Predicted with complete certainty 
- Ex: Tree Farm

Stochastic Processes
========================================================

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](06-Maps-as-Processes-Slides-figure/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

***
- Both random and Deterministic 
- Ex: Forest (Random Component), Fence (Deterministic Component)

Simulating Spatial Processes
========================================================

***

- Probability of an event increases in the "East" direction
- Natural Process causing this trend? Escarpment present?  

Concluding Remarks
========================================================
- Not all processes are the same
- Null landscapes are completely random 
- Spatial processes have practical applications
